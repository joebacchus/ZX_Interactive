# ZX_Interactive
An educational platform for teaching quantum computing through the lens of ZX Calculus.

Four sections can be completed independently:
- Develop the standard webpage with capacity ready for all elements. `Demo_page`
- Build the protocol for generating the scroll-based ZX animations (non-interactive).
- Create a web-based interactive ZX editor for sandbox mode and exercises. `Sandbox`
- Write both lessons and exercises for the course.

The final mission is then to bridge these all together.
